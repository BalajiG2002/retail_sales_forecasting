# 📊 Sales Forecasting Project

Welcome to the Sales Forecasting Project! This project aims to forecast the number of units sold for various stores on Amazon. The entire process is documented in a Jupyter notebook, covering everything from data loading to model evaluation.

## 🗂 Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the dataset files used for the project.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with code and analysis.
- **results/**: Folder for storing prediction results and evaluation metrics.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for various steps in the pipeline.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## 🔧 Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-forecasting-project.git
   cd sales-forecasting-project
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/sales_forecasting.ipynb
   ```

## 📈 Workflow

The project follows a structured workflow to ensure clarity and reproducibility:

1. **Data Loading** 📂
   - Load datasets in various formats.
   - Initial data inspection and cleaning.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔍
   - Visualize data distributions and relationships.
   - Identify patterns and trends in the data.

3. **Feature Engineering** 🛠️
   - Create new features to enhance model performance.
   - Handle missing values and categorical data.

4. **Model Selection** 🤖
   - Compare different machine learning models.
   - Choose the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning** 🎛️
   - Optimize model parameters using techniques like Grid Search and Random Search.
   - Improve model accuracy and generalizability.

6. **Model Evaluation** 📊
   - Evaluate model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
   - Validate results with cross-validation and test sets.

## 📄 Submission

1. Ensure your Jupyter notebook includes all necessary steps such as data loading, EDA, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation. Include comments and explanations for clarity.
2. Submit the following files:
   - Jupyter notebook (.ipynb)
   - PDF version of the notebook
   - File with predicted results

## 🚀 Getting Started
